This simple Python package will allow you to fully analyse your Facebook group chats! Some basic analysis features are provided but the tools are there for you to analyse the data however you like. 

Some examples of plots this program can produce are on [the project page](https://conor-or.github.io/fb-analysis/). To get started with using fb-analysis yourself, check out the [getting started guide](https://conor-or.github.io/fb-analysis/getting-started). There is also [documentation](https://conor-or.github.io/fb-analysis/documentation) for most of the methods in the script.
